      <h1>File Sharing!!</h1>
      <h2>Our motivation:</h2>
      <article>
        Why have chosen "File Sharing" as our topic?<br><br>
        Because we believe that information should be free and available for everyone at any given time<br>
        We try to provide an easy way to share your files!<br>
      </article>
      <h2>What should our website do?</h2>
      <article>
        First of all it should be simple and user-friendly but still have a certain amount of style.
        <h3>Focus in the 1. term:</h3>
          <p>The first thing to implement will be static HTML-Site which will be
             made fancier by using css.<br>
             We will write content to explain the risks of file sharing<br>
             and present some big file-sharing-plattforms.
          </p>
        <h3>Focus in the 2. term:</h3>
        <p>When the whole graphical part is over we will start to set up a server<br>
           where everyony can down and upload his stuff and<br>
           we will (possibly) create an Login-system with e-mail verification.
